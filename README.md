## Introduction
TypeScript is a powerful superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. This guide covers essential concepts and features that will help you write robust and maintainable TypeScript code.

## Basic TypeScript Types
Learn about the fundamental types in TypeScript, including:
- `string`
- `number`
- `boolean`
- `null` and `undefined`
- `any`
- `void`


## Custom TypeScript Types
Explore how to create your own types using:
- **Interfaces**: Define the shape of an object.
- **Type Aliases**: Create a new name for a type.
- **Enums**: Define a set of named constants.
- **Classes**: Implement object-oriented programming principles.

## Generics
Understand how to create reusable components and functions with generics, allowing you to work with any data type while maintaining type safety.

## TypeScript Utilities
Discover built-in utility types that can help you manipulate types effectively:
- `Omit<T, K>`: Create a type by omitting certain properties.
- `Pick<T, K>`: Create a type by picking specific properties.
- `Partial<T>`: Make all properties in a type optional.
- `Required<T>`: Make all properties in a type required.

## Promises
Dive into asynchronous programming with Promises in TypeScript, including how to handle asynchronous operations and error management.

## TypeScript with React
Learn how to integrate TypeScript with React to build type-safe components and manage props and state effectively.

## TypeScript with Express
Explore how to set up a TypeScript project with Express, including type definitions for request and response objects.
